<h1>Assignment: First experience with testing and Agile work-flow</h1>
<p>Completed the following tests as assigned, by following the instructions</p>
<p>Collaborated with several other students as well as help from instructors, thanks!</p>
<p>A lot of this was very new to me and diving straight in was what seemed to work the best for me.  Having the solutions available helped when wondering if I was doing something correctly and to compare.</p>
